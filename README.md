Compresses and Decompresses .txt files using Huffman Code. 
To encode a file, run Huff.java with your .txt file as an argument. (e.g. java Huff.java Frankenstein.txt)
Compression using Huff will create a corresponding file appended with .puff (e.g. passing in Frankenstein.txt to Huff would create new Frankenstein.txt.huff file)
To decompress a .puff file, use Puff.java passing in the .puff file as an argument. (e.g. java Puff.java Frankenstein.txt.puff)
